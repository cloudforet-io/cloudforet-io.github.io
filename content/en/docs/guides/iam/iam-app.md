## Creating an App

To use Cloudforet(SpaceONE)'s CLI tool,Â [Spacectl](https://github.com/cloudforet-io/spacectl), you need an accessible Client Secret.

You can create an app with the Workspace Owner role in a specific workspace and provide the Client Secret key of that app to other users.

(1) Click the \[+ Create] button in the upper right corner
