To use Cloudforet's services, the following three prerequisites must be met:

- User settings
- Project settings
- Service account settings

## User settings

Cloudforet users are classified into three types: **internal users**, **external users**, and **API users**.

This section only introduces how to add internal users, and how to add external users and API users can be found in [[IAM] user guide](/docs/guides/iam/iam-user).

### Adding a user

(1) Click the [Create] button on the [Admin > Users] page.

(2) In the [Create user] modal, select the [Local] tab.

(2-1) After entering the ID, click the [Check ID] button to check if the ID is valid.

{{<alert title="Assign administrator’s privileges">}}
If you want to give a user administrator’s privileges, you can assign them by selecting them from the [Assign admin role] dropdown.

If nothing is selected, no privileges will be granted to that user.

For a more detailed information on permissions, see [here](/docs/guides/administration/iam-role).
