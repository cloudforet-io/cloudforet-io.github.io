## Overview

### Cloudforet-Minikube Architecture

![Cloudforet-Minikube Architecture](images/port_forwarding_architecture.png)

---

## Prerequisites

- AWS EC2 VM (Intel/AMD/ARM CPU)
  > Recommended instance type: t3.medium (2 cores, 4 GB Memory, **30GB EBS**)
- [Docker/Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
  - If you don't have Docker installed, minikube will return an error as minikube uses docker as the driver.
  - Highly recommend installing **Docker Desktop** based on your OS.
- [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/)
  - Requires minimum **Kubernetes version of 1.21+**.
- [Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)
  - Requires minimum **Helm version of 3.11.0+**.
  - If you want to learn more about Helm, refer to [this](https://helm.sh/).

Before diving into the Cloudforet Installation process, start minikube by running the command below.

```
minikube start --driver=docker --memory=4096mb
```

> If you encounter `Unable to resolve the current Docker CLI context "default"` error, check if the docker daemon is running.

## Installation

You can install the Cloudforet by the following the steps below.

### 1) Setting up Helm Chart Repository

This command adds Helm repository.

```bash
helm repo add cloudforet https://cloudforet-io.github.io/charts
```

This command updates repositories basd on latest version of chart repository.

```bash
helm repo update
```

This command list contents of the repository.

```bash
helm search repo
```

### 2) Create Namespaces

> If you want to use only one namespace, you don't have to create the `spaceone-plugin` namespace.

```bash
kubectl create ns spaceone
```

```bash
kubectl create ns spaceone-plugin
```

### 3) Create Role and RoleBinding

First, download the [rbac.yaml](https://github.com/cloudforet-io/charts/blob/master/examples/rbac.yaml) file.

The rbac.yaml file basically serves as a means to regulate access to computer or network resources based on the roles of individual users. For more information about RBAC Authorization in Kubernetes, refer to [this](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/).

If you are used to downloading files via command-line, run this command to download the file.

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudforet-io/charts/master/examples/rbac.yaml -O rbac.yaml
```

Next, execute the following command.

```bash
kubectl apply -f rbac.yaml -n spaceone-plugin
```

### 4) Install Cloudforet Chart

This command basically let Helm search for the chart named cloudforet in the repository named spaceone. For more information about what chart is, refer to [this](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts/).

```bash
helm install cloudforet cloudforet/spaceone -n spaceone --version 1.12.10
```

After executing the above command, check the status of the pod.

> Scheduler pods are in `CrashLoopBackOff` or `Error` state. This is because the setup is not complete.

```bash
kubectl get pod -n spaceone

> To execute the commands below, every POD except xxxx-scheduler-yyyy must have a Running status.

### 5) Initialize the Configuration

First, download the [initializer.yaml](https://github.com/cloudforet-io/charts/blob/master/examples/initializer.yaml) file.

For more information about the initializer, please refer to the [spaceone-initializer](https://github.com/cloudforet-io/spaceone-initializer).

If you are used to downloading files via command-line, run this command to download the file.

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudforet-io/charts/master/examples/initializer.yaml -O initializer.yaml
```

And execute the following command.

```bash
helm install initializer cloudforet/spaceone-initializer -n spaceone -f initializer.yaml
```

### 6) Set the Helm Values and Upgrade the Chart

Complete the initialization, you can get the system token from the initializer pod logs.

To figure out the pod name for the initializer, run this command first to show all pod names for namespace spaceone.

```bash
kubectl get pods -n spaceone
```

Then, among the pods shown copy the name of the pod that starts with **initialize-spaceone as well as the complete status**.

```bash

> To execute the below kubectl logs command, the status of POD(Ex: here initialize-spaceone-fsqen-74x7v) should be Completed . Proceeding with this while the POD is INITIALIZING will give errors

Get the token informtion by running kubectl log command with your pod name you found above.

```bash
kubectl logs initialize-spaceone-fsqen-74x7v -n spaceone

...
TASK [Print Admin API Key] *********************************************************************************************
"TOKEN_SHOWN_HERE"

FINISHED [ ok=23, skipped=0 ] ******************************************************************************************

FINISH SPACEONE INITIALIZE
```

"After you get the TOKEN, simply create the `values.yaml` file and copy-paste the below YAML content into it, then only edit your TOKEN value you received earlier."

> For EC2 users: put in your EC2 server's public IP instead of 127.0.0.1 for both CONSOLE_API and CONSOLE_API_V2 ENDPOINT.

- TOKEN

```yaml
console:
  production_json:
    CONSOLE_API:
      ENDPOINT: http://127.0.0.1:8081 # http://ec2_public_ip:8081 for EC2 users
    CONSOLE_API_V2:
      ENDPOINT: http://127.0.0.1:8082 # http://ec2_public_ip:8082 for EC2 users

global:
  shared_conf:
    TOKEN: "TOKEN_VALUE_FROM_ABOVE" # Change the system token you get
```

After editing the `values.yaml` file, upgrade the helm chart.

```bash
helm upgrade cloudforet cloudforet/spaceone -n spaceone -f values.yaml
```

After upgrading, delete the pods related to the namespace named spaceone.
After upgrading, delete the pods in spaceone namespace that have the label app.kubernetes.io/instance and value cloudforet.

```bash
kubectl delete po -n spaceone -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=cloudforet
```

### 7) Check the status of the pods

```bash
kubectl get pod -n spaceone
```

If all pods are in `Running` state, the setup is complete.

## Port-forwarding

Installing Cloudforet on minikube doesn't provide any Ingress objects such as Amazon ALB or NGINX ingress controller.
We can use **kubectl port-forward** instead.

Run the following commands simultaneously for port forwarding.

```bash
# CLI commands
kubectl port-forward -n spaceone svc/console 8080:80 --address='0.0.0.0' &
```

```bash
kubectl port-forward -n spaceone svc/console-api 8081:80 --address='0.0.0.0' &
```

```bash
kubectl port-forward -n spaceone svc/console-api-v2-rest 8082:80 --address='0.0.0.0' &
```
