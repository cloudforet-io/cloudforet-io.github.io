</br>

Frontend Core microservices' codes are integrated and built, uploaded with the flow explained above. Most of the workflows include set-up process including setting Node.js, caching node modules, and installing dependencies. After the set-up proccess, each repository workflow is headed to building process proceeded in NPM. After building, both repositories' packages built are released in NPM by code `npm run semantic-release`. 

</br>

Check semantic-release site, [npm: semantic-release](https://www.npmjs.com/package/semantic-release) for further details about the release process.

</br>

Also, unlike other repositories deployed by the flow from Docker to Spinnaker and k8s, spaceone-design-system repository is deployed differently, based on direct deployment through AWS S3. 

</br>

To check the details, go to the `.github/workflow` directory in each directory.
