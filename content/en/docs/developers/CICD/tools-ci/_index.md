## Tools CI process details

</br>

</br>

spacectl, spaceone-initializer, tester repositories are tools used for the spaceone project. There are some differences from other repositories' CI process. 

</br>

spacectl repository workflow includes test code for each push with a version tag, which is similar to the CI process of backend core repositories. 

</br>

spaceone-initializer repository does not include the workflow file triggered by ‘master branch push’, which most of repositories including spacectl and tester have. 

</br>

Tools-category repositories use different repositories to upload.
* spacectl : PyPi and Docker both
* spaceone-initializer : Docker
* tester : PyPi

</br>
</br>

To check the details, go to the `.github/workflow` directory in each directory.
